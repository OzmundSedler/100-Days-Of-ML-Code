Hello world!
100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by Siraj Raval

## Day 1 - 4 hours :

**Courses and Lectures** :

Yandex - [Supervised learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning/home/welcome) - week 2 

PyData Ann Arbor: Caitlin Hudon - [Building Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBamzdiwic)

**Theory** : 

Linear model. MSE. Regression. Regularization (l1,l2). Logistic regression. Fisher's linear discriminant. Generalized linear models. Prediction of probabilities and estimation of parameters.

Practical advices on linear models. Feature scaling. Straightening spaces. Work with categorical features. Work with Unbalanced data. Multi-class classification.
