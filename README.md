**Other** :

Digging into collab and this github repo to make it beautiful :)

## Day 2 - 2.5 hours :

**Courses and Lectures** :

#io19

**Theory** : 

Tensorflow piplines e.t.c. from io19. 

**Practice** : 

All described the day before in theory section .

Sklearn. Best parameters search. Grid search.

Bike Sharing Demand case. Data preprocessing. Feature scaling. Pipelines.


**Notebooks** :

## Day 3 - 1.5 hours :

**Courses and Lectures** :

Yandex - [Supervised learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning/home/welcome) - week 3, started coding exercise. 

[TensorFlow Extended: Machine Learning Pipelines and Model Understanding (Google I/O'19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drYM04t57tU)

**Practice** : 

Doing coding exercise of Yandex week 3. Suffering from old libs functions. Refactoring it to new versions.

**Notebooks** :

Will be finished next day

## Day 4 - 4 hours :

**Courses and Lectures** :

Yandex - [Supervised learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning/home/welcome) - week 3, finished coding exercise. God, translation to english was real pain XD Now i need to find beautiful man, that will help me to correct it XD

**Practice** : 

Finished coding exercise of Yandex week 3.

**Notebooks** :

[Data preprocessing and logistic regression for binary classification tasks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15gX4xDvG_8BkqSts3EMbkz4W5ZivndL-)

Dunno if anybody will need it, but i plan to continue translating exercises from this course, becouse they are actually really good (i'd say like Andrew NG practice x2). I opened comments, so feel free to help XD
